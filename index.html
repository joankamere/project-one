  <h3>About me <em>Joan Kamere</em></h3>
  <p>I joined university in 2017 and graduated with a degree in psychology in 2020. I got my first job in April 2020 and
    I am still working to-date. I took this class to gain the skills needed to create an app in line with my interest in
    psychology. By the end of this class I hope to have an understanding on what creating such an app will entail.
    Depending on how things go I will make the decision whether or not I want to proceed with core but for now I am
    enjoying the process.
    Some of my interests and hobbies include; going out with friends, cooking, reading, listening to music, watching
    movies and series. Although I rarely have any free time, I still make an effort to do something I enjoy once in a
    while so as to keep me grounded.</p>
